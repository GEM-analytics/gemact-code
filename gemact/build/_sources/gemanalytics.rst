**Gabriele Pittarello** (*Owner, Developer*)


I am postdoctoral researcher in the Section of Biostatistics, at the Department of Public Health of the University of Copenhagen.

I obtained my PhD in 'Advances in Claims Reserve Modelling' from the School of Statistical Sciences at 'La Sapienza' University of Rome.

My research interests are primarily survival analysis, claims reserving models in non-life insurance and computational methods for non-life insurance.
