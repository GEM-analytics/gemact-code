The structure of the vignettes included in this folder is the following:

- **Manuscript code blocks.ipynb** contains the code blocks included in the [GEMAct manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01129)
- **Supplementary material on Section 3.ipynb** provides the supplementary code to replicate *Section 3.6 Comparison of the methods for computing the aggregate loss distribution* and *Section 3.7. Comparison with aggregate FFT implementation* of the [GEMAct manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01129).
- **Supplementary material on Section 4.ipynb** provides the supplementary code to replicate *Section 4.2. Comparison of the methods for computing the cdf* of the [GEMAct manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01129).
- **Supplementary material on Section 5.ipynb** provides the supplementary code to replicate *Section 5.2.1. Comparasion with chain ladder* of the [GEMAct manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01129). 
- **Supplementary material on the data generator.Rmd** provides the R code to simulate the data generation process used in *Section 5. Loss Reserve* and *Appendix C Claims Reserving with the Fisher-Lange* of the [GEMAct manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01129). It also includes the algorithm to compute the PE of the reserve in Section *Section 5.2.1. Comparasion with chain ladder*
