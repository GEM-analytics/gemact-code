# GEMAct

GEMAct is a comprehensive **actuarial package**, based on the collective risk theory framework, that offers a set of tools for **non-life** (re)insurance **costing**, stochastic **claims reserving**, and **loss aggregation**.

The variety of available functionalities makes GEMAct modeling very flexible and provides actuarial scientists and practitioners with a powerful tool that fits into the expanding community of **Python** programming language.

# Future work

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in helping us in expanding our package, you can find our contact details [here](https://gem-analytics.github.io/gemact/gemanalytics.html). Possible future enhancements could involve the introduction of new probability distribution families, the implementation of supplementary methodologies for the approximation of quantiles of the sum of random variables, and the addition of costing procedures for exotic and nontraditional reinsurance solutions.
